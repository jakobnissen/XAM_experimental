XAM Done:
Remove hasflag (mandatory both in SAM and BAM)
Remove isfilled() checks from all BAM operations.
For BAM, all hasX should return a Bool
Fix hasnextrefname
RNAME should be able to be read even when read is unmapped (as per specs 1.4.3)
Methods now return missing if information is not available.
An empty BAM record is now a legitimate BAM record
BAM.seqname_length now returns the true length instead of length + 1
Implemented get(::Record, tag, default)
Implemented pop!(::Record, tag) and pop!(::Record, tag default)
Implemented delete!(::Record, tag)
Implemented setindex!(::Record, tag, value)
Deleted AuxValue object
auxvalues(::Record) now returns a dict
Fields of BAM object are now 1:1 with BAM file specs
BAM now supports reading hex bytes auxiliary fields (of type H). When written,
these are automatically converted to UInt8 byte array (type BC).
SAM no longer displays next_ref as =, but as real name
Can now convert a BAMRecord to a SAMRecord
Fixed bug in extracting auxdata of type Vector from SAM records

XAM Todo:

== Find out the dependencies

=== Move tests to own files

=== Change SAM interface to follow the BAM one

=== Add an interface for creating SAM and BAM headers more easily
	- update_header(header, [segments])
	- create_header(segments)

	New interfaces:
		S Perhaps make an interface to add SQ headers from seq of records

	Docs:
		Update docs about how to write BAM files: Currently formatting errors, and doesn't mention header in example code

	Bugfixes:
		sam/metainfo/func MetaInfo should check that tag is two characters.
		Also, no newline in comments. No checks in general for bad headers!
		function record/isnextmapped(record::Record)::Bool: FLAG_MUNMAP should be SAM.FLAG_MUNMAP, has no tests

		metainfo/findkey and record/findkey and aux/findkey should return nothing rather than 0 when no key
		BAM writer: Add check that the indices are not longer than number of refs
